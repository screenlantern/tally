Your task is to create a small web application using React, and style it with SCSS to match a design spec provided.

Please find the designs in the "screenshots" folder. There are 3 images, each for a different screen size.

The aplication will need to fetch some fake user data from a remote JSON API and display the results as shown in the screenshots.

When the "Load More" button is tapped, the application should fetch more users and append them to the page.

-------

The project should be set up and ready to use straight away. To get started:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then point your browser to `http://localhost:5000`.

In the `src` directory you will find "App.jsx", which should be the root component of your React application.

You'll also find "styles.scss" which provides a normalized starting point for styles.


The API endpoint to fetch users is: `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=n`

Please use the HTML5 "Fetch" API for making HTTP requests instead of a library. If you are unfamiliar with Fetch, you may have to research it before continuing.

Please do not use any UI frameworks or libraries for styling (apart from the normalize, included). We would like to see Flexbox used to create the grid layout.

Feel free to structure the project in the way that you feel is best, but there is no need to create a "production ready" application. Try not to spend longer than ~2 hours on it.

We will be looking at:

- Implementation decisions that you make
- How you choose to structure your code
- How closely you match the design spec

-------

When you're finished, please ZIP your entire project folder (except node_modules!) and email it back to us. You may have to upload the file to Google Drive or similar in order to send it via email.

Thank you and good luck!
